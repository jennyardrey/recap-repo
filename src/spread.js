// I need to organise some bands for my rEcOrDs. Please create the following variables:
// 1. a new object called fiveGuys containing all the objects for bands with 5 members
// 2. a new array containing just the first and last bands

//BEFORE YOU DO THE FOllOWING read the instructions and then head over to the test file to write a few tests to test your new variables before you write them.
// I have fulfilled my lifelong dream of persuading The Spice Girls and Slipknot to form a supergroup. Use the spread operator to create a new object assigned to the new bandname with the new number of members and all the names of the members in an array.
