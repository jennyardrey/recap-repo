This exercise is intended to help you recap some of the concepts covered in the Foundations Module you have just completed.

We will be comvering the following - 
1. Building an ES5 object, converting it to a class.
2. Replacing data on the testing side by mocks/spies
3. Destructuring some objects
4. Using the spread operator
5. Creating a function that takes default parameters

Much like the Bake Off technical challenge I will provide you with limited instructions - 

- Get this repo on your own remote and make a new branch for your solutions
- Install all dependencies
- Work your way through the files following the instructions
- When you are done create a pull request and merge your solutions branch into master
- Watch out for bugs!
